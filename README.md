# Stock Analysis & Portfolio Optimization

Stock analysis and portfolio optimization is implemented using the python programming language and streamlit with the intent of aiding investors in the analysis of securities and helping them in optimizing their portfolios. 

## The project consists of two parts - 

- The first part is stock analysis, whereby the user must input the ticker symbol of the security to be analysed. Then by obtaining the financial data, the program displays a variety of information about the stock and then we run an ARIMA model to predict the future trend of the stock price.
- The second part is about portfolio optimization, wherein a user creates a portfolio of different stocks and the system finds the most optimal portfolio allocation for those stocks. Also, the user can enter his expected return and the program will return the best risk optimized portfolio for that return.
